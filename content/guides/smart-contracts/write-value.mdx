# Calling a smart contract function

When you want to call a function that is not a view function (meaning it changes the state of the blockchain), you need to send a transaction to the smart contract. This is done by using the `sendTransaction` method of [MiniKit](https://docs.world.org/mini-apps/commands/send-transaction).

## Installing MiniKit

We need to install the `@worldcoin/minikit-js` package to use MiniKit in our Mini App project so we can interact with smart contracts.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @worldcoin/minikit-js
```

Also make your life easier by installing [viem](https://viem.sh/). It comes with a lot of useful functions to interact with smart contracts.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install viem
```

<Callout type="info">
  This libraries come installed by default when using the `create-world-app`
  command used in the [Writing your first Mini
  App](/learn/guides/your-first-mini-app) tutorial.
</Callout>

## Here is a quick example to get you started

```ts filename="App.tsx"
"use client"

import { MiniKit } from "@worldcoin/minikit-js"
import { erc20Abi } from "viem" // We import the ERC20 ABI from viem

const sendTransaction = async () => {
  // The following method will try to transfer
  // 1 WLD token from the World App to another address
  // using the `transfer` function of the ERC20 contract.

  const WLD_TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0x2cFca85d8E48F8EAB294be644d9E25C3030863003"
  const RECIPIENT_ADDRESS = "0x05a700132Fb88D4F565453153E6b05F2049fCb45"

  const { commandPayload, finalPayload } =
    await MiniKit.commandsAsync.sendTransaction({
      transaction: [
        {
          address: WLD_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
          abi: erc20Abi,
          functionName: "transfer",
          args: [
            RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, // Address you want to send tokens to
            parseEther("1"), // 1 WLD token
          ],
        },
      ],
    })
}
```

### Here we are introduced to a some new concepts:

- **ABI**: Application Binary Interface. This is essentially a `guide` or an interface that tells developers how to interact with smart contracts. An **API** if you will, but for smart contracts.
- **ERC20**: An standard interface for tokens on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/). It defines how tokens can be transferred, how to get the balance of an account, and other basic functionalities.
- **parseEther**: A utility function in viem that converts a number to its representation with 18 decimal places. This is necessary because smart contracts often use integers not decimals, that's why we use a mantissa to represent the decimal places. For example, **1 WLD** token is represented as `1000000000000000000` in the smart contract.
