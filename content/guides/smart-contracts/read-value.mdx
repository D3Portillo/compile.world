# Reading a value from a smart contract

World Apps run in Worlchain, an **EVM compatible blockchain**, which means you can interact with smart contracts using the same methods as you would on Ethereum or other EVM chains.

For reading a value from a smart contract, you can use a library like [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) for react or [viem](https://viem.sh/) for vanilla JavaScript. These libraries provide a simple way to interact with smart contracts and read values from them.

## Example using wagmi

```javascript filename="App.tsx"
"use client"

import { useReadContract, erc20Abi } from "wagmi"

export function App() {
  const WLD_TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0x05a700132Fb88D4F565453153E6b05F2049fCb45"
  const { data: totalSupply } = useReadContract({
    abi: erc20Abi,
    address: WLD_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    functionName: "totalSupply",
  })
}
```
