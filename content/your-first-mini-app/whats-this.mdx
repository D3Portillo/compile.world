# Amazing... but how do I code the thing?

When you open the mini app folder you will see a bunch of files and folders, which might look a bit overwhelming at first. You'll get used to it, don't worry. The most important files for you to know about are:

- `app/page.tsx`: This is the main file of your Mini App. It's where you will write your code and build your app.
- `app/Brr.tsx`: In React, everything is a component. And this is a sample component you can use to get to know how components work.
- `app/global.css`: Used to give some style ðŸ’… to our Mini App. We won't be using this file too much because instead our app comes equiped with TailwindCSS.
