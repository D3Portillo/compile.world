# 💊 Nice, you've taken the red pill!

Before we start, there are a few things you need to do to get ready for building your first Mini App:

- NodeJS installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- A code editor. We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- A terminal. You can use the one that comes with your operating system or install a new one like [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for macOS or [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) for Windows.
- Have World App installed on your phone. You can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/world-app/id6443592217) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.worldcoin.worldapp).
- Tea or coffee to keep you energized during the process ☕️
- Willingness to learn, experiment, and have fun! 🎉
