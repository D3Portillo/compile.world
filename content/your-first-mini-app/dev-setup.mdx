# 💊 Nice, you've taken the red pill!

Before we start, there are a few things you need to do to get ready for building your first Mini App:

- NodeJS installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- A code editor. We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- A terminal. You can use the one that comes with your operating system or install a new one like [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for macOS or [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) for Windows.
- Have World App installed on your phone. You can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/world-app-worldcoin-wallet/id1560859847) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.worldcoin).
- Tea or coffee to keep you energized during the process ☕️
- Willingness to learn, experiment, and have fun! 🎉

# 🛠️ Setting up the development environment

Let's start by creating a new project from a template. This will give us a good starting point with all the necessary files and configurations.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npx create-world-app my-app
```

The command gives you a prompt to select a template. You can choose the recommended one (Next 14).

```ansi
[0;32m➜[0m npx create-world-app my-app
[0;32m┌[0m  Let's create your mini app
[0;32m│[0m
[0;32m◆[0m  Select a template
[0;32m│[0m  [1;32m●[0m Next 14 (recommended)
[0;32m│[0m  [2m○[0m Next 15
[0;32m└[0m
```

The process will take a few minutes to complete. Once it's done, you will have a new folder called `my-app`. We need to open this folder in our code editor to start working on our Mini App.

There are many ways to do it, here are a few options:

- **VsCode Command**: In the current terminal, run the command `code my-app`
- **The App Command**: In the terminal, run the command `open -a "Visual Studio Code" my-app`
- **The Drag and Drop Method**: Open your code editor and drag the `my-app` folder into it

And that's it! You are now ready to build the dopest Mini App ever! 🎉
