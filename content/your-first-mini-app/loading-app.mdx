# How to view your app

So, all Mini Apps are built using Web Technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This means you can view your Mini App in a web browser just like any other website.

Using web technologies helps us to quickly see how our app looks like without needing to constantly check it inside the World App.

# How to view my Mini App?

To view your Mini App in a browser, follow these steps:

<Steps>

## Locate the `mini-app` folder

Search for the `my-app` folder you created earlier. This is where our Mini App files are stored. If you followed the previous steps, it should be where you ran the `create-world-app` command.

## Start the development server

Open a terminal in the `my-app` folder. You can do this by right-clicking the folder and selecting "Open in Terminal" or using your code editor's terminal feature.

And run the following command to start the development server:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

## Open your browser

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser. This is where your Mini App should be running
