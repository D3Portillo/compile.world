# Compile the World

This is a place where you can learn how to buil Mini Apps for Worldchain.

---

If you're new to Worldchain and Mini Apps we recommend starting with the [Worldchain 101](/learn/mini-apps-101/worldchain). It will give you a solid foundation about mini apps, the Worldchain ecosystem, and how to get started.

Else, if you are looking for a more hands-on approach, you can continue with the [Your First Mini App](/learn/your-first-mini-app) guide which walks you through building your first mini app step by step.
