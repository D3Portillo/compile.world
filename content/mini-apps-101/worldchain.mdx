# What's Worldchain?

Worldchain is a new kind of blockchain made by the team behind Worldcoin (co-founded by Sam Altman). It’s built to focus on real humans, not bots.

## Key ideas:

- **Human verification:** People use World ID to prove they’re real.
- **Fair access:** Verified humans get faster and cheaper access to apps.
- **Useful for communities:** It's made for real-world apps like payments or ID checks.
- **Fast and secure:** Runs on technology from Ethereum, but cheaper and more scalable.
