# What's Worldchain?

Worldchain is a blockchain designed to help real people use digital services easily and securely by proving they are human and not a bot. The process is done by analyzing your biometric data (like your iris) which helps to confirm you are a real human being.

## Key ideas

- **Human verification:** People can use services labeled "for humans only" by proving they are a real person.
- **Fair access:** Verified humans get faster and cheaper access to apps.
- **Useful for communities:** It's made for real-world apps like payments or ID checks.
- **Fast and secure:** Runs on technology from Ethereum, but cheaper and more scalable.
