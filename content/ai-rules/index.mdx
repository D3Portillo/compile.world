# AI Assisted Development

This section covers how to use AI tools to assist with coding tasks, including setting up various AI models and integrating them into your development workflow.

## Build faster with AI

AI tools can significantly speed up your development process by automating repetitive tasks, generating code snippets. Here are some tools and frameworks you can explore:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<RiClaudeLine />}
    title="Claude"
    href="/learn/ai-rules/claude"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<PiCursorClickFill className="scale-95" />}
    title="Cursor"
    href="/learn/ai-rules/cursor"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<PiTerminalWindowBold className="scale-105" />}
    title="Windsurf"
    href="/learn/ai-rules/windsurf"
  />
</Cards>

## Portable Context for AI Assistants

[`LLMS.txt`](https://llmstxt.org/) is a standard for providing LLM-friendly documentation access. This project automatically generates `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files to help you add as context to your AI assistants.
