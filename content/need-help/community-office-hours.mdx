# Join our Community Office Hours

We host weekly community office hours where you can ask questions, get help with your Mini Apps, and connect with other developers.

See this as an special session to showcase work, get direct support from the core team, and validate your ideas.

## When do we meet?

We meet every **Thursday at 4:00 PM UTC** on [Worldchain Discord](https://world.org/discord) in the [`#office-hours`]() channel.

## Anything I need to prepare?

Nope! Just bring your questions, if you have any, else it's fine to join us and listen to the conversation. Other developers might share their work, ideas, and challenges, and you can learn from them too.
